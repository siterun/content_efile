Following are some main difference between abstract classes and interface in php

1 In abstract classes this is not necessary that every method should be abstract. But in interface every method is abstract.
2 Multiple and multilevel both type of inheritance is possible in interface. But single and multilevel inheritance is possible in abstract classes.
3 Method of php interface must be public only. Method in abstract class in php could be public or protected both.
4 In abstract class you can define as well as declare methods. But in interface you can only defined your methods.
